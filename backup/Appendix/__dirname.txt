Static middleware and sendFile() are mostly the same - they both pipe the file stream to response stream.

The difference is that express.static will:

- set ETag for you
- allow you to set extension fallbacks (for example html -> htm)
- sendFile on the other hand will:

set the Content-Type response HTTP header based on file extension
They both will:

- set max-age property on Cache-Control
- set Last-Modified header
- allow you to set any other headers through options object
- allow you to ignore dotfiles

The main advantage of using static middleware is that you don't need to write specific route for every 
file separately (or sanitize parameters) but just point the middleware to the right directory.
